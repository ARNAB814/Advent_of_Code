# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges, an annual December event featuring a series of small programming puzzles. Each solution aims to demonstrate efficient coding practices and problem-solving skills.

## Languages Used
- Python

## Structure
Each year's challenges are organized into separate directories, named after the year (e.g., `2020`, `2021`). Inside each year's directory, there are subdirectories for each day, labeled `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.
